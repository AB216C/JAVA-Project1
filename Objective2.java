/*
Objective 2:
Write a program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of characters in each word
while maintaining the original order of words.

Requirements:

Prompt the user to input a sentence (a string with multiple words separated by spaces).
Use a StringBuilder to reverse each word individually.
Print the modified sentence with each wordâ€™s characters reversed, but the word order kept the same.
Example:

Input: "Hello World from Java"
Output: "olleH dlroW morf avaJ"
